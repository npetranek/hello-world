# hello-world
well... here we are at square one. i think the biggest thing that is motivating me to finally get my feet wet with more advanced tech stuff is that im noticing a lot of people younger than me - keep in mind that im only 21 - know a lot about coding and developing. i want my piece of the pie. so now im starting to claim my piece of the pie.
